# Intro

## Goals
- Understand what reproducibility is and why it's important
- Give you practical tips for organizing your project
- Have concrete ideas for where to find help and new ideas

## Caveat
- I'm no reproducibility guru...
- ...but hopefully I can share a few tips to make your life easier

## 2nd years: Choosing a language
- Stata
    + Heavily used in economics
- R
    + Oriented towards data analysis
    + I use this :)
- Python
    + More general purpose programming
- Pick one and get really good at it; you can learn another language later
    
# Reproducibility

## What is reproducibility?
- With the same data, you can reproduce the same set of results
- NOT replicability
- NOT correctness 

## Practical goals of reproducibility
- You can run your entire workflow, from raw data to final paper, in one keystroke
- Your project should be self-contained
     + i.e. you can reproduce your work on any machine in the world

## Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good
- Reproducibility tools take time and effort to learn
- Sometimes project-specific constraints make it difficult to attain an idealized version of reproducibility 

## Reproducibility makes your life easier
- Ensures "correctness" i.e. you're doing what you think you're doing
- Easy for others to trace your steps and build on your work
- "Others" includes future you!
    
# Reproducibility workflow in R/RStudio

## What if you're not using R?
- These principles are applicable across languages
- Some will have similar tools or tools may be common across languages
- E.g. check out Project Manager in Stata

## Projects
- Use RStudio's *Projects* feature
- Easy to keep your projects organized separately
- Can open multiple sessions at the same time

## Folder structure principles
- Most basic: separate folders for code, data, output
- Additional rules you can apply
    + separate raw and intermediate data 
    + separate types of code e.g. cleaning and analysis
    
## Creating a new project
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("start_project.png")
```

## Version control
- Avoid this: file_final_v2_oops_reallyfinal_revised_v7.docx
- Like time travel, or saving and loading in a video game
    + Can even create alternate timelines to test your code
- Easy to keep code on multiple computers updated

## Version control software
- Git + Github
- Git is a version control system
- Github is an online version control repository

## Git is intimidating
- Start small; I use two commands (`push` and `pull`) 99% of the time
- Using a Git client like GitKraken can make it more intuitive
- More [at this link](http://happygitwithr.com/) for getting started with Git/Github

## Dynamic documents
- Don't cut and paste figures/tables/numbers - easy to make mistakes
- Integrate code and prose
- Any changes to your data will be automatically reflected in the text
- In R this is done with R Markdown

## Example 
- I want to say: The flights dataset has `N` observations and `K` variables
```{r ex2a}
library(nycflights13)
dim(flights)
```

- The `flights` dataset has `` `r '\x60r dim(flights)[1]\x60'` ``  observations and `` `r '\x60r dim(flights)[2]\x60'` `` variables
- The `flights` dataset has `r nrow(flights)` observations and `r ncol(flights)` variables

# Coding

## Coding style
- Look up style guides for whatever language you use
- You may get conflicting advice on style; just be consistent
- E.g. in R, many style guides will say `x <- 5`, but a substantial minority say `x = 5` - just choose one
- Human-readable; with auto-complete, object names can be a bit longer
- [This is a problem with STATA wildcards](https://weiyangtham.github.io/verbosity-code/)

## Defensive coding
- Mistakes will happen - your goal is not to write mistake-free code, but to write code that catches those mistakes early
- Insert tests in your code - e.g. after merging two datasets, a line that stops the code from running if some observations were not matched
- Readable code makes mistakes easier to spot
- Don't transcribe

## Projects set your home directory
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Type this in your console after opening a project
getwd()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
here::here()
```

- You can save a script in any subfolder in the project directory and it will always start from the project's root directory

## Use relative directories!
- Suppose you want to load a file from the `data` folder
- `"data/file.csv"`
- Not `"/Users/weiyangtham/Documents/Projects/file.csv"`
