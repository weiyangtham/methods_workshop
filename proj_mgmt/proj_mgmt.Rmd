# Intro

## Goals
- Understand what reproducibility is and why it's important
- Give you practical tips for organizing your project
- Have concrete ideas for where to find help and new ideas

## Caveat
- I'm no reproducibility guru...
- ...but hopefully I can share a few tips to make your life easier

## 2nd years: Choosing a language
- Stata
    + Heavily used in economics
- R
    + Oriented towards data analysis
    + I use this :)
- Python
    + More general purpose programming
- Pick one and get really good at it; you can learn another language later
    
# Reproducibility

## What is reproducibility?
- With the same data, you can reproduce the same set of results
- NOT replicability
- NOT correctness 

## Practical goals of reproducibility
- You can run your entire workflow, from raw data to final paper, in one keystroke
- Your project should be self-contained
     + i.e. you can reproduce your work on any machine in the world

## Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good
- Reproducibility tools take time and effort to learn
- Sometimes project-specific constraints make it difficult to attain an idealized version of reproducibility (e.g. data is on a remote machine)

## Reproducibility makes your life easier
- Ensure "correctness" i.e. you're doing what you think you're doing
- Easy for others to trace your steps and build on your work
- "Others" includes future you!
    
# Reproducibility workflow in R/RStudio

## What if you're not using R?
- These principles are applicable across languages
- Some will have similar tools or tools may be common across languages
- E.g. check out Project Manager in Stata

## Projects
- Use RStudio's *Projects* feature
- Easy to keep your projects organized separately
- Can open multiple sessions at the same time

## Folder structure principles
- Most basic: separate folders for code, data, output
- Additional rules you can apply
    + separate raw and intermediate data 
    + separate types of code e.g. cleaning and analysis
    
## Creating a new project
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("start_project.png")
```

## Helpful links
- [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
- [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html)

## Version control
- Avoid this: file_final_v2_oops_reallyfinal_revised_v7.docx
- Time travel, or saving and loading in a video game
- Great if you have to work on multiple computers

## Version control software
- Git + Github
- Free private repository for students

## Git is intimidating
- Start small; I literally use two commands 99% of the time

## Dynamic documents
- Integrate code and prose

# Coding

## Coding style
- Look up style guides for whatever language you use
- You may get conflicting advice on style; most important thing is to be consistent

## Projects set your home directory
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Type this in your console after opening a project
getwd()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
here::here()
```

- You can save a script in any subfolder in the project directory and it will always start from the project's root directory

## Use relative directories!
- Suppose you want to load a file from the `data` folder
- `"data/file.csv"`
- Not `"/Users/weiyangtham/Documents/Projects/file.csv"`

## Defensive coding

## Cautionary note on Stata
- Wildcards can lead to unclear code
